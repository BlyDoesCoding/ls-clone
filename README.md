## Day 1: ls-clone

A tiny **C** program that mimics `ls` but adds a splash of colour and emojis to make directory listings.

The project is part of a personal coding challenge: Write a small C Programm Every Day (When i have Time(probably never))

---

### Features

- Lists files in the current directory (or a path passed as an argument).  
- Detects file type by extension and applies colour + emoji.  
- Works on Linux/macOS (uses `dirent.h` and ANSI escape codes).  
- No external dependencies â€“ just the C standard library.
